Project Objective:
To develop a user-friendly, interactive website for medical students and other healthcare professionals that standardises documentation of neurological examination findings, assists in lesion localisation, and suggests appropriate next steps for further evaluation.

Project Background:
Neurological examination is a necessary skill for healthcare professionals involved in disease diagnostics. However, inconsistencies in the documentation and a lack of guidance in interpreting findings can result in missed or incorrect diagnoses. A tool that standardises documentation and guides lesion localisation and next steps will greatly benefit patients in getting the right diagnosis and treatment.
